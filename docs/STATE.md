# Where the build is

Last updated: 17 Aug 2026, end of Session 4.

Read this first when picking the work back up. `docs/SPEC.md` is still the
contract and `claude-code-sessions.md` is still the plan — this file only says
what is done, what runs, and what is next.

---

## Running it

```bash
npm install          # once
npm run dev          # starts the dev database AND the web server
```

| Surface | URL | Who |
|---|---|---|
| Franchisee | http://localhost:3000/freshbites | no login; tokenized links |
| Signage.com team | http://localhost:3000/admin | allowlisted team email |
| Corporate reviewer | from a link in the approval email | no login, ever |
| Outbox (dev) | http://localhost:3000/dev | what would have been emailed |

Sign in to `/admin` as `team@signage.com` — with no Supabase project configured
the login screen is a picker over `team_members`, which is a stand-in for a
login, not a login (see below).

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | dev database (port 5433) + Next (port 3000), together |
| `npm run dev:db` / `npm run dev:web` | either half on its own |
| `npm run dev:db:reset` | wipe `.pglite/` and re-seed from scratch |
| `npm run smoke` | drive the real flows in a browser — 67 checks (needs `npm run dev` up) |
| `npm run sla` | run the review-SLA timer once (also at `/api/cron/review-sla`) |
| `npm test` | 58 unit tests — the §6 state machine and the seed pins |
| `npm run db:verify` | apply all migrations to a throwaway Postgres, 13 schema checks |
| `npm run seed` | seed a real target; set `DATABASE_URL` first |

**There is no Docker on this machine**, so `supabase start` cannot run. Instead
PGlite (Postgres compiled to WASM) runs as its own process speaking the real
Postgres wire protocol, and the app connects with `pg`. Point `DATABASE_URL` at
a Supabase connection string and the identical SQL runs there.

**No mail is delivered.** With no `RESEND_API_KEY`, every message is rendered
and recorded in `sent_emails` instead of being sent, and `/dev` is how you read
it — including clicking the approval links a reviewer would click. Set the key
and the same code sends through Resend.

**The dev database serves one connection at a time.** The app's pool is capped
at one in dev and releases it after 500 ms idle, so a script can still connect
while `next dev` runs — but two clients at once get `ECONNRESET`. Anything that
talks SQL directly (the seed, the smoke test) should connect, work, disconnect,
and retry. If it starts refusing every connection, it has wedged — restart
`npm run dev:db`.

Uploaded files land in `.storage/` (gitignored) and are served from
`/api/files/…`. Setting `SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` makes the app refuse that path
on purpose — the Supabase driver is not written yet.

Also useful: the reference app at `reference/design-studio` (`npm run dev` inside
it, port 5173) serves `/demo` — the canonical v12 UX reference — and `/flow`.

---

## Done

**Session 0** — `docs/design-studio-findings.md`: what the retail Design Studio
can and cannot do, from its source, with eight flagged contradictions against
SPEC §8 and the question list for Usman. Plus `docs/FLOW.md` and `/flow`.

**Session 1** — Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4; the full SPEC §2–§5 schema
in five migrations including the §8b fields and §8c `did_requests`; the §10 RLS
policies; `src/lib/status/` as the single write path for request status; the seed
(taxonomy + Freshbites + Oak Plaza).

**Session 2 — the franchisee interface** (SPEC §9 interface 1), against the real
database: the co-branded home; the tokenized status page (per-item status,
prices, vendor chips, TBD and exception callouts, attached photos, quote card
with accept, production progress, timeline); the intent picker; the like-for-like
fast lane; add-signs; the four-step initial setup including the §8b financing
question and the lease sign exhibit; the change-request loop with real editing;
and real uploads behind `src/lib/storage/`.

**Session 3 — the team queue** (SPEC §9 interface 2) at **`/admin`**:

- Sign-in gated by the `team_members` allowlist, re-checked on every request.
- Queue bucketed by whose move it is (needs prep · with corporate · with
  franchisee · ready to route · in fulfillment · installed), with fast-lane
  badges and to-review / reopened / TBD rollups.
- Detail view with the whole action chain, showing only what is legal now:
  prepare package (with the §8b landlord criteria check), route for quote,
  manual pricing for standin items, per-item mockup upload, deliver quote,
  production → shipped → installed, and manual `landlord_approval` logging plus
  free-text notes.
- Both tails: internal drives production in-portal; external logs the vendor
  quote and the order placed with them, then the install.
- `Mark installed` performs the `installed_signs` writeback — replacements update
  the row they replace rather than duplicating it.

**Session 4 — the approval email and the reviewer's links** (SPEC §9 interface 3):

- The approval email, co-branded, leading with how many items are proceeding
  WITHOUT corporate and then one card per pending item — spec, origin, vendor,
  price, mockup, exception text, TBD note — with Approve / Request changes /
  Decline per item.
- Those buttons are signed links to `/review/{token}`: hashed in the database,
  expiring after 7 days, revoked the moment the package version changes, and
  retired once nothing is pending. Opening one decides nothing — mail scanners
  follow links, so the decision happens on the page.
- The re-review email on resubmission, which mints a new link and kills the old
  one.
- The SLA timer: `npm run sla`, `/api/cron/review-sla` (Bearer `CRON_SECRET`),
  and a daily Vercel cron. `remind` re-asks, `escalate` writes to the secondary
  reviewer or corporate, `auto_forward` records the brand's policy and tells the
  team to confirm — **nothing is ever approved by a clock**.
- `/dev` is now the outbox: every message the system sent or would have sent.
  The reviewer stand-in that lived there is deleted — the real links replaced it.
  The outbox itself stays useful once mail is live ("what exactly did we send
  them"), but it is still guarded and still unauthenticated: keep it only if it
  earns its place, and put it behind `/admin` if it does.

---

## Next: Session 5 — routing emails, notifications, lender documents

Per `claude-code-sessions.md`: the vendor package email (the routing that builds
the packages already exists in `src/lib/db/routing.ts`), the seven franchisee
notification templates, the §8b lender PDFs (budgetary quote, formal invoice,
paid receipt, budget one-pager), and the §8d welcome email.

Worth settling first: **entry 20** — a brand has one vendor contact but §4 routes
per item, so the pylon override has no address of its own. Session 5 is where
that stops being cosmetic.

---

## Owed, and worth clearing early

- **No behavioural RLS tests.** The policies are verified as valid SQL, never as
  behaviour: the dev database connects as the table owner, so RLS is present but
  never consulted. Token scoping rests on the WHERE clauses in
  `src/lib/db/queries.ts` and the ownership checks in each server action.
  **The first time a real Supabase project exists, test that anon cannot read
  another location's rows.** Still the largest untested assumption in the build.
- **No mail has ever actually been sent.** The Resend path in
  `src/lib/email/send.ts` is written and unexercised; everything so far has gone
  to the outbox. The templates, links, triggers and SLA around it are exercised
  by the smoke suite.
- **The Supabase Auth path has never run.** `/admin` authenticates through a dev
  cookie here; the magic-link send and session read in `src/lib/auth/team.ts` are
  written against an API nothing on this machine has called. The allowlist half —
  the part that actually decides access — is exercised by the smoke suite.
- **The seed has never run against Supabase**, only against the dev database.
- **The Supabase Storage driver is unwritten** — local disk only.
- **`src/lib/supabase/clients.ts` and `src/lib/env.ts` are still unused.**

## Decisions waiting on you

In `docs/DECISIONS.md`, none blocking:

1. Should SPEC §6 gain a terminal request-level `declined`, or is an
   all-declined request closed by hand? Today the derivation refuses to guess
   and returns `blocked: 'all_items_declined'`.
2. SPEC §5.4 should gain `changes_requested` as a fifth `line_item_status`.
3. Session 2's calls (entries 14–19): submission stopping at `submitted`, the
   structured address, optional sizing on add-ons, the note-on-timeline when no
   lease exhibit is provided, resolving the change request on resubmission, and
   storing uploads before the request exists.
4. **Worth answering before Session 5** (entry 20): a brand has exactly one
   `vendor_name`/`vendor_email`, but §4 resolves routing per item — so the
   Freshbites pylon's `approved_vendor` override has no address of its own and
   falls back to the brand's only vendor contact. Routing and the package split
   are right; the address is not. §3.1 needs per-policy vendor contacts before
   anything is actually emailed.
5. Session 3's calls (entries 23–26), chiefly the split between swappable
   identity and fixed authorization in `/admin`.
6. Session 4's calls (entries 27–33), chiefly: **one link per email rather than
   per button** (a per-click link would break the other buttons in the same
   message), and **`auto_forward` never approving anything** — SPEC §3.1 offers
   it as a policy, and a timer that approves signage puts words in a
   franchisor's mouth.

And unchanged from CLAUDE.md: the Design Studio integration path, the pilot
brand's real vendor policy, the stamp decision, the business model, the DID fee
amount, and the v13 flow demo (Session 8 stays blocked on it).
